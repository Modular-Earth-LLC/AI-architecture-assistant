# Sales and Solution Architecture Process

This directory contains the complete five-phase engagement process for acquiring clients and delivering AI agent system prototypes. Each phase includes email templates, meeting guides, and specialized AI agent prompts that can automate or augment the process.

## Process Overview

**Phase 1: Initial Engagement** - Discovery call to understand client needs and establish fit
**Phase 2: Requirements Gathering** - Structured workshop to map business operations and identify AI opportunities  
**Phase 3: Prototype Development** - Build working AI agent system based on requirements
**Phase 4: Prototype Review** - Demonstrate prototype and gather feedback
**Phase 5: Partnership Discussion** - Present production proposal and partnership opportunities

## How to Use This Process

### Manual Execution

1. Review the meeting guides and email templates for each phase
2. Customize templates with client-specific information
3. Follow the scripts and agendas during client interactions
4. Use the checklists to ensure nothing is missed

### AI-Augmented Execution  

1. Use the orchestrator agent to manage the overall engagement workflow
2. Deploy specialized agents for specific tasks (email composition, note-taking, requirements analysis)
3. Review and approve agent outputs before sending to clients
4. Use meeting facilitator agents as real-time copilots during workshops

### Fully Autonomous Execution (Future State)

1. Orchestrator agent manages entire engagement with human oversight at decision points
2. Agents compose and schedule emails automatically
3. Meeting facilitator agents lead workshops with human supervision
4. Prototype builder agents develop working systems autonomously
5. Human reviews at phase transitions only
