**Subject:** Requirements Workshop for [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME] AI Agent System

[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

Thank you for the insightful conversation [yesterday/on DATE]. I'm excited about the opportunities we identified, particularly around [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT_FROM_DISCOVERY].

Based on our discussion, I'd like to propose a requirements gathering workshop. This ninety-minute working session will help us map your business operations in detail and identify exactly where AI agents can provide the most value. The output will be a requirements document that I'll use to build a custom prototype for [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME].

## Workshop Overview

This session is structured around six key areas that will help me understand your business deeply enough to build effective AI agents:

1. **Industry and Market Positioning** - Your competitive landscape and differentiation
2. **Brand Voice and Values** - How you communicate and what you stand for  
3. **Go-to-Market Strategy** - How you acquire and serve clients
4. **Core Service Delivery** - Detailed workflow mapping for your key services
5. **Business Objectives** - What you're trying to achieve and what's in the way
6. **Technology Stack** - Tools you use and how they connect

The more detailed and opinionated you can be during this workshop, the better the AI agents will align with how you actually work. I'm particularly interested in understanding the nuances and unique approaches that differentiate [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME] from other [INDUSTRY] [professionals/companies].

## How to Prepare

Before our workshop, please gather any existing documentation you have around your business operations. This might include:

- Service descriptions or case studies
- Client onboarding materials
- Templates you use regularly (financial models, reports, presentations)
- Process notes or SOPs (even rough or outdated ones)
- Examples of typical client deliverables

These don't need to be polishedâ€”they just need to reflect how you actually work. Even rough notes or slightly outdated documents are valuable because they show your thinking.

Also, start thinking about your **three most time-consuming or frustrating operational tasks**. We'll dig into these during the workshop to understand if they're good candidates for AI augmentation.

## Scheduling

I'd like to schedule this within the next week while our discovery conversation is fresh. I'm available:

- [SPECIFIC_DATE_TIME_OPTION_1]
- [SPECIFIC_DATE_TIME_OPTION_2]
- [SPECIFIC_DATE_TIME_OPTION_3]

The workshop works best as an uninterrupted ninety-minute block. Please let me know which time works best for you, and I'll send a calendar invitation with the video conferencing link.

Looking forward to diving deeper into [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME]'s operations.

Paul
