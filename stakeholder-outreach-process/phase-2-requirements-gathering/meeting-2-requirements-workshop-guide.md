## Workshop Opening (5 minutes)

**Script:**

"[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME], thanks for making this time. Over the next ninety minutes, we're going to map out [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME]'s operations in detail. This will feel quite thorough‚Äîthat's intentional. The more I understand about how you work, the better I can build AI agents that fit seamlessly into your process rather than fighting against it.

I'll be taking notes throughout and asking lots of specific questions. There are no wrong answers‚ÄîI need your honest operational reality, not an idealized version. If something is messy or inconsistent, that's fine. Most businesses have some of that.

We'll cover six areas: your market positioning, your brand, how you go to market, how you deliver services, your business objectives, and your technology stack. The bulk of our time will be on service delivery because that's where AI agents have the most impact.

Any questions before we dive in?"

**Agent Support:**

- requirements-workshop-agent displays agenda on screen share
- notetaker-agent begins capturing conversation
- requirements-workshop-agent sets 90-minute countdown timer

## Workshop Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

### Summary and Validation

**Script:**

"[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME], this has been incredibly valuable. Let me summarize what I'm hearing as the highest-priority opportunities:

**[Summarize top 3-5 opportunities with specific agent types]**

For example:

1. A **report automation agent** that pulls data from [TOOL] and generates your standard financial reports, reducing your 8-hour manual process to 1 hour of review
2. A **research assistant agent** that gathers industry data and competitive intelligence for your client proposals, cutting proposal prep time in half
3. A **client communication agent** that drafts follow-up emails and status updates in your voice, freeing you from routine correspondence

Does that align with your priorities? Is there anything I'm missing or misunderstanding?"

### Next Steps Communication

**Script:**

"Here's what happens next:

1. I'll compile everything we discussed today into a detailed requirements document within 48 hours
2. You'll review that document to ensure I captured everything accurately
3. Once you confirm the requirements, I'll spend about two weeks building a working prototype
4. We'll meet again in about three weeks for you to interact with the actual AI agents

The prototype won't be a slideshow or a demo video‚Äîit will be a functional system you can actually use with your real work to see if it delivers value.

I've scheduled our prototype review meeting for [DATE/TIME]. Does that work for your calendar?"

### Final Questions

**Script:**

"Before we wrap up‚Äîany questions about the process? Anything else about your operations I should know that didn't fit into today's structure?"

### Agent Guidance for Wrap-Up

Proposed process: [AI_AUGMENTED_METHOD]

[Repeat for 2-3 more agents]

Do these align with where you'd want to start?"
MEETING SCHEDULING:
Do not leave workshop without confirmed prototype review date.
If client uncertain: "Let's tentatively hold [DATE]. I'll send confirmation once the prototype is closer to ready."

- Priorities unclear
- No confirmed next meeting

---

## Common Workshop Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge:** Client provides only surface-level answers

**Solution:**

- Use the "tell me about last time" approach
- "Rather than generally, tell me about the last time you did [TASK]. Walk me through that specific instance."
- Real examples force specificity

**Challenge:** Client jumps between topics and goes off on tangents

**Solution:**

- "That's really interesting and I want to capture it. Let me make a note and we'll come back to it after we finish [CURRENT_SECTION]."
- Keep visible list of "parking lot" topics to return to

**Challenge:** Client says "it depends" for every workflow question

**Solution:**

- "I understand it varies. What are the 2-3 most common scenarios?"
- Capture variations as workflow branches
- Focus on the 80% case, note exceptions

**Challenge:** Client doesn't know technical details of their tools

**Solution:**

- "That's fine‚Äîwe'll figure out the technical details. Just tell me what you use it for day-to-day."
- Make note to research tools independently
- Focus on use cases rather than technical specs

**Challenge:** Running significantly over time

**Solution:**

- At 60-minute mark: "We have 30 minutes left and still need to cover [X] and [Y]. I may need to schedule a brief 30-minute follow-up call to capture the remaining details. Let's prioritize [MOST_CRITICAL_SECTION] for the rest of today."
- Better to schedule follow-up than rush

**Challenge:** Client fixates on what AI can't do

**Solution:**

- Validate their concern: "You're absolutely right that AI can't [X]. That's exactly why we're not proposing to automate that."
- Redirect: "Your judgment on [X] is irreplaceable. What we're looking at is whether AI can handle the [routine/repetitive/time-consuming] parts so you have more time for [strategic/high-value] work."

**Challenge:** Client provides contradictory information

**Solution:**

- Flag immediately: "Help me understand‚Äîearlier you mentioned [A], but just now you said [B]. Can you clarify the difference?"
- Often reveals important nuances about when different processes apply

**Challenge:** Client is clearly overwhelmed by the depth of questions

**Solution:**

- Reassure: "I know this feels very thorough. That thoroughness is what allows me to build something that actually works for how you operate, not a generic tool that creates more work."
- Offer break: "Would a 5-minute break be helpful?"
