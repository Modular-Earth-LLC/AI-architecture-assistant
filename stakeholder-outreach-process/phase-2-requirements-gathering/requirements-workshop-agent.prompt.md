"This part is tedious but necessary" ‚Üí HIGH priority
"I wish I could delegate this" ‚Üí HIGH priority
"Requires my judgment" ‚Üí MEDIUM/LOW priority
"Every client needs this" ‚Üí HIGH priority (scalable)

EXAMPLE PROBING:
Client: "I create financial reports"
Agent prompts:

"Walk me through creating one report from start to finish"
"What data sources do you pull from?"
"How much is formula-driven vs narrative?"
"What parts could someone else do with clear instructions?"

TIME MANAGEMENT:

‚úì Technology stack captured
‚úì AI opportunities identified
PRIORITY VALIDATION:
Present to client: "Based on what you've shared, the highest-value opportunities seem to be:

[AGENT_TYPE] for [SPECIFIC_TASK] - saves [TIME]/week
[AGENT_TYPE] for [SPECIFIC_TASK] - saves [TIME]/week
[AGENT_TYPE] for [SPECIFIC_TASK] - saves [TIME]/week

Does that align with your priorities?"
NEXT STEPS COMMUNICATION:
"I'll compile this into a detailed requirements document within 48 hours. You'll review it to ensure accuracy. Then I'll spend about two weeks building a working prototype that you can actually interact with. We'll schedule a review meeting for [DATE_3_WEEKS_OUT]. Sound good?"
SCHEDULE REVIEW MEETING NOW:
Don't leave workshop without confirmed prototype review date.

## Adaptive Questioning

### When Client Gives Surface-Level Answers:

**Client:** "I do financial consulting."

**Agent Prompts Human:**

‚ö†Ô∏è TOO VAGUE - Need specificity
Suggested follow-ups:

"What specific financial problems do you solve?"
"Walk me through a recent client engagement from start to finish"
"What's a typical deliverable you create?"

### When Client Gives Excellent Detail:

**Client:** "I start by pulling data from their QuickBooks, then I build a 13-week cash flow model in Excel using this specific template I've developed. The model has three scenarios - best case, expected, and worst case. Then I create a presentation deck in Google Slides that explains the findings. The whole process takes about 6-8 hours per client."

**Agent Prompts Human:**

‚úÖ EXCELLENT CAPTURE
This contains:

Data source (QuickBooks)
Process (cash flow modeling)
Tool (Excel template)
Deliverable (presentation deck)
Time (6-8 hours)

üî¥ HIGH-PRIORITY AI OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED:
Report automation agent could:

Pull QuickBooks data automatically
Generate cash flow scenarios
Create presentation slides
Reduce 6-8 hours to 1 hour of review/customization

Continue exploring: "Is that template the same for every client, or do you customize it?"

### When Client Goes Off Track:

**Agent Prompts Human:**

‚ö†Ô∏è OFF TRACK: Currently discussing [TANGENT_TOPIC]
Time: [X] minutes in Section [Y]
[Y] remaining sections to cover
Gentle redirect: "That's interesting context. Let me capture that and come back to it. I want to make sure we cover [NEXT_TOPIC] before we run out of time."

## Common Workshop Challenges

**Challenge:** Client doesn't know their workflows in detail
**Solution:** Walk through recent real example step by step. "Think about the last time you did this. What was the first thing you did?"

**Challenge:** Client jumps between topics
**Solution:** "Let me capture that - it's important. I want to come back to it after we finish [CURRENT_SECTION]."

**Challenge:** Client fixates on AI limitations
**Solution:** "You're right that AI can't do [X]. That's exactly why we focus on [Y] tasks that are well-defined. Your expertise on [X] is irreplaceable."

**Challenge:** Running over time
**Solution:** "We have [X] minutes left and [Y] sections to cover. I may need to schedule a brief follow-up call to capture remaining details. Let's prioritize [MOST_CRITICAL_SECTION]."

**Challenge:** Client provides contradictory information
**Solution:** Flag in real-time: "Earlier you mentioned [A], but just now you said [B]. Can you help me understand the difference?"
