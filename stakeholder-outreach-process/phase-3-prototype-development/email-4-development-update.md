**Subject:** [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME] AI Agents - Development Update

[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME],

Quick update on your AI agent system: Development is progressing well. I've completed the foundational architecture and am now implementing the specific agent capabilities we discussed.

## Current Status

The agents are taking shape around [SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY_1] and [SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY_2]. I'm particularly excited about [SPECIFIC_FEATURE_THAT_ADDRESSES_PAIN_POINT]—it's handling [SPECIFIC_TASK] in a way that should save you significant time.

Here's what's complete:

✓ Multi-agent system architecture  
✓ Integration framework for [PRIMARY_TOOL] and [SECONDARY_TOOL]  
✓ [AGENT_NAME_1] - Core functionality built  
✓ [AGENT_NAME_2] - In progress  

Next up: [REMAINING_WORK_DESCRIPTION]

## On Track for Review

I'm on track for our review meeting on **[DATE] at [TIME]**. You'll be able to interact with the working prototype during that session and see exactly how the agents handle real scenarios from your practice.

The prototype will include:
- [NUMBER] fully functional agents
- Integration with your [PRIMARY_TOOLS]
- A simple interface for interacting with the agents
- Demo scenarios based on your actual workflows

If any questions come up between now and then, feel free to reach out.

## Required Inputs

- `CLIENT_FIRST_NAME`: Client's first name
- `CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME`: Company name
- `SPECIFIC_CAPABILITY_1/2`: Key capabilities being built
- `SPECIFIC_FEATURE_THAT_ADDRESSES_PAIN_POINT`: Compelling feature that solves a pain point
- `SPECIFIC_TASK`: The task this feature automates/augments
- `PRIMARY_TOOL` / `SECONDARY_TOOL`: Client's main tools being integrated
- `AGENT_NAME_1/2`: Names of specific agents being built
- `REMAINING_WORK_DESCRIPTION`: Brief description of remaining work
- `DATE` and `TIME`: Confirmed prototype review meeting
- `NUMBER`: Number of agents in prototype
- `PRIMARY_TOOLS`: Main tools in their stack

## Agent Instructions

The email-composer-agent should:

1. Keep email brief (under 250 words) - this is an update, not a full report
2. Include specific technical details to demonstrate real progress
3. Highlight one particularly exciting capability that addresses a major pain point
4. Use checkmarks or bullets to show completed work visually
5. Reinforce the review meeting date/time
6. Maintain enthusiasm without overselling
7. Avoid technical jargon the client won't understand
8. Don't ask for anything from the client—this is purely informational

## Success Criteria

- Email demonstrates tangible progress
- Client feels reassured development is on track
- Client remains engaged and excited
- Meeting date reinforced
- No response required (but appreciated if client replies with excitement)

## Follow-Up Actions

- If client responds with questions: Answer promptly
- If client expresses concerns: Address immediately and transparently
- If client requests changes: Assess feasibility and adjust scope if needed
- Continue development toward prototype review meeting
