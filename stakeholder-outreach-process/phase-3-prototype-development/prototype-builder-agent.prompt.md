## Requirements-to-Prompt Translation

When translating requirements into agent prompts:

### From Service Workflow to Agent Capability

**Requirements Document Says:**
"Client manually pulls financial data from QuickBooks, builds cash flow model in Excel using template, generates 3 scenarios, creates presentation deck. Takes 6-8 hours per client."

**Agent Prompt Should Include:**

**Role:** Financial Report Automation Agent

**Core Capabilities:**

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Connect to QuickBooks via API
   - Extract relevant financial data (revenue, expenses, cash position)
   - Validate data completeness and accuracy

2. **Cash Flow Modeling**
   - Apply client's proprietary 13-week cash flow template
   - Generate three scenarios: best case, expected, worst case
   - Calculate key metrics (runway, burn rate, break-even)

3. **Report Generation**
   - Create narrative analysis of findings
   - Generate visualizations (charts, graphs)
   - Format output for client's presentation template

**Operating Context:**
- **Client:** [NAME], specializes in SaaS financial consulting
- **Industry:** B2B SaaS companies, $1M-$10M ARR
- **Brand Voice:** Analytical yet accessible, avoids jargon, focuses on actionable insights

### From Brand Voice to Communication Style

**Requirements Document Says:**
"Brand voice: 'Do business, better.' Professional but approachable. Avoids consultant-speak. Values clarity over complexity. ESG-conscious language."

**Agent Prompt Should Include:**

**Communication Style:**
- Use clear, direct language (avoid: "leverage," "synergize," "utilize")
- Lead with insights, not process (client cares about "what this means" not "how we calculated it")
- Include specific numbers and examples
- Frame recommendations as collaborative suggestions, not prescriptive mandates
- Acknowledge social/environmental implications where relevant
- Tone: Professional colleague, not corporate consultant

**Example Phrasing:**
- ✓ "Your cash runway is 7 months based on current burn rate. Here are three ways to extend that..."
- ✗ "Per our analysis, we've identified that the financial runway, leveraging current expenditure trajectories..."

---

## Test Scenario Generation

For each agent, generate 5 types of test scenarios:

### 1. Happy Path Scenarios
Standard use cases where everything works as expected

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** Standard financial report generation
- **Input:** Client name, date range, QuickBooks connection
- **Expected Output:** Complete financial report with 3 scenarios
- **Success Criteria:** Report generated in <30 seconds, all sections complete, formatting correct

### 2. Edge Case Scenarios
Unusual but valid inputs that might break the agent

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** Partial data availability
- **Input:** QuickBooks connection with missing expense categories
- **Expected Output:** Report generated with data gap warnings
- **Success Criteria:** Agent identifies gaps, generates report with available data, flags what's missing

### 3. Error Scenarios
Invalid inputs or system failures

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** QuickBooks API unavailable
- **Input:** Request for report when API is down
- **Expected Output:** Graceful error message with suggested alternatives
- **Success Criteria:** No system crash, clear explanation of issue, suggestion to try again later

### 4. Ambiguous Input Scenarios
Unclear or incomplete user requests

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** Vague user request
- **Input:** "Make me a financial thing for XYZ Corp"
- **Expected Output:** Clarifying questions to user
- **Success Criteria:** Agent asks for: report type, date range, specific data needed

### 5. Integration Scenarios
Multi-agent workflows requiring coordination

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** User asks research agent a question that requires financial data
- **Input:** "What's our client's market position compared to industry benchmarks?"
- **Expected Output:** Research agent coordinates with financial agent for client data
- **Success Criteria:** Seamless handoff, combined insights, single coherent response

## Code Generation Guidelines

When generating integration code:

### API Integration Template

```python
import requests
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

class [ToolName]Connector:
    """
    Integration with [Tool Name] for [Client Company Name]
    Purpose: [What this integration does]
    """
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, base_url: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.headers.update({
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        })
    
    def retrieve_data(self, params: Dict) -> Dict:
        """
        Retrieve data from [Tool Name]
        
        Args:
            params: Dictionary containing query parameters
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing retrieved data
            
        Raises:
            ConnectionError: If API is unavailable
            ValueError: If data validation fails
        """
        try:
            response = self.session.get(
                f"{self.base_url}/endpoint",
                params=params,
                timeout=10
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
            
            # Validate data structure
            if not self._validate_data(data):
                raise ValueError("Retrieved data failed validation")
                
            return data
            
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            raise ConnectionError(f"Failed to connect to [Tool Name]: {str(e)}")
    
    def _validate_data(self, data: Dict) -> bool:
        """Validate that retrieved data has expected structure"""
        required_fields = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']
        return all(field in data for field in required_fields)
    
    def write_data(self, data: Dict) -> bool:
        """
        Write data to [Tool Name]
        
        Args:
            data: Dictionary containing data to write
            
        Returns:
            True if successful, False otherwise
        """
        try:
            response = self.session.post(
                f"{self.base_url}/endpoint",
                json=data,
                timeout=10
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return True
            
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Failed to write data: {str(e)}")
            return False
```

### Implementation Recommendations

#### Agent Orchestration
For simple prototypes (3-5 agents):

```python
class SimpleOrchestrator:
    """
    Basic orchestrator for routing user requests to appropriate agents
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'financial': FinancialAgent(),
            'research': ResearchAgent(),
            'communication': CommunicationAgent()
        }
    
    def route_request(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Determine which agent should handle request"""
        # Simple keyword-based routing for prototype
        keywords = {
            'financial': ['report', 'cash flow', 'revenue', 'expenses'],
            'research': ['market', 'competitor', 'industry', 'trends'],
            'communication': ['email', 'message', 'write', 'draft']
        }
        
        for agent_name, agent_keywords in keywords.items():
            if any(keyword in user_input.lower() for keyword in agent_keywords):
                return self.agents[agent_name].process(user_input)
        
        # Default to general agent if no match
        return self.agents['communication'].process(user_input)
```

> **Note:** For production, recommend LLM-based routing instead of keyword matching.

#### Quality Assurance

**Agent Output Validation**
For each agent, implement output validation:

```python
def validate_agent_output(output: str, agent_type: str) -> tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """
    Validate agent output meets quality standards
    
    Returns:
        (is_valid, list_of_issues)
    """
    issues = []
    
    # Check minimum length
    if len(output) < 50:
        issues.append("Output too brief")
    
    # Check for placeholder text
    placeholders = ['[INSERT]', 'TODO', 'PLACEHOLDER', 'TBD']
    if any(p in output for p in placeholders):
        issues.append("Contains placeholder text")
    
    # Check for brand voice alignment (agent-specific)
    if agent_type == 'communication':
        forbidden_phrases = ['leverage', 'synergize', 'utilize', 'paradigm']
        if any(phrase in output.lower() for phrase in forbidden_phrases):
            issues.append("Uses forbidden jargon")
    
    # Check formatting
    if agent_type == 'financial':
        if not any(char.isdigit() for char in output):
            issues.append("Financial report missing numbers")
    
    return (len(issues) == 0, issues)
```

## Development Best Practices

### Start with Simplest Implementation

**Don't:**
```python
# Complex multi-layer neural architecture for prototype
class AdvancedAgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.routing_model = self.load_custom_llm()
        self.agent_graph = self.build_complex_graph()
        self.memory_system = self.initialize_vector_db()
        # 500 more lines...
```

**Do:**
```python
# Simple but functional for prototype
class BasicOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = self.load_agents()
    
    def route(self, input):
        # Simple routing that works
        return self.determine_agent(input).process(input)
```

### Prioritize Functionality Over Perfection

For prototype phase:

- ✅ Working demo with 3 agents
- ✅ Realistic test scenarios
- ✅ One working integration
- ❌ Perfect error handling for every edge case
- ❌ Production-grade scalability
- ❌ Complete test coverage

Polish comes in production development.

## Problem-Solving Prompts

When human encounters issues, provide structured troubleshooting:

### Issue: Agent produces inconsistent outputs

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- What's the temperature setting? (Try 0 for consistency)
- Is the prompt providing sufficient context?
- Are examples included in the prompt?
- Is the input varying significantly?

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Lower temperature to 0
- Add more examples to prompt showing desired output format
- Include output schema in prompt
- Add output validation and retry logic

### Issue: Agent integration failing

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Is the API endpoint correct?
- Is authentication working?
- What error code is being returned?
- Is the data format correct?

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Test API calls independently (Postman/curl)
- Verify credentials haven't expired
- Check API documentation for format changes
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Implement fallback to simulated data for demo

### Issue: Agent doesn't understand user intent

**Diagnosis Questions:**
- Is the user input too vague?
- Does the prompt include examples of similar inputs?
- Is the agent's scope too broad?
- Should this be handled by a different agent?

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Add clarification logic to agent
- Include more diverse examples in prompt
- Narrow agent's scope and create specialized agent
- Improve routing logic in orchestrator
