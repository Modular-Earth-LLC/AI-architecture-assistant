## Meeting Agenda

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Script:**
"[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME], thanks for making time today. I'd like to spend the next thirty minutes understanding how [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME] operates and where you see opportunities for improvement. My goal is to determine if AI agents could genuinely help your practice, and if so, what that might look like. This is exploratory, so please be candid about what's working and what isn't."

**Agent Support:**

- meeting-facilitator-agent displays agenda on screen share
- notetaker-agent begins capturing conversation

### Business Understanding (10 minutes)

**Key Questions:**

1. "Can you describe [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME]'s core services in your own words?"
2. "Who is your typical client, and what does a standard engagement look like?"
3. "Walk me through your role - what do you personally handle versus delegate?"
4. "What tools and systems do you use daily?"

**Agent Support:**

- meeting-facilitator-agent tracks question coverage
- notetaker-agent flags important business model details
- meeting-facilitator-agent prompts for follow-up questions based on responses

**What to Listen For:**

### Pain Point Identification (10 minutes)

**Key Questions:**

1. "What aspects of your work take the most time but feel repetitive?"
2. "Where do you feel bottlenecked in scaling your practice?"
3. "What tasks do you wish you could delegate but can't justify hiring for?"
4. "What client deliverables take longer than you'd like?"

**Agent Support:**

- meeting-facilitator-agent categorizes pain points in real-time (operational, strategic, technical)
- notetaker-agent captures exact client language for pain descriptions
- meeting-facilitator-agent identifies patterns across responses

### AI Opportunity Framing (3 minutes)

**Script:**
"Based on what you've shared, I see some interesting opportunities. For example, [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT_1] sounds like something an AI agent could handle. In practices similar to yours, we've built agents that [RELEVANT_EXAMPLE]. These aren't replacing your judgment, they're handling the [repetitive/time-consuming/routine] parts so you can focus on [strategic/high-value] work."

**Agent Support:**

- meeting-facilitator-agent suggests 2-3 relevant example use cases from database
- Agent presents simple visual of how agents would fit into client's workflow
- notetaker-agent captures client's reaction and questions

**Approach:**

- Keep it concrete and specific to their pain points
- Avoid overwhelming with technical details
- Focus on time savings and quality improvements
- Introduce Service-as-Software concept briefly if client seems sophisticated

---

### Next Steps (2 minutes)

**Script:**
"What I'm hearing suggests there could be some interesting opportunities to build AI agents that handle specific aspects of your workflow. The next step, if you're interested, would be a more structured workshop where we'd map out your processes in detail and identify where AI could provide the most value. This would take about ninety minutes and would give us enough information to build a working prototype. Does that sound like something worth exploring?"

**Agent Support:**

- meeting-facilitator-agent displays next steps visually
- orchestrator-agent prepares workshop scheduling options
- notetaker-agent captures commitment level and any concerns

**Decision Point:**

- Client confirms interest → Trigger Phase 2 sequence
- Client needs time → Schedule follow-up check-in
- Client declines → Capture feedback for lead qualification refinement

## Post-Meeting Tasks

### Human Tasks

- Review meeting notes and agent-generated summary
- Validate key insights captured
- Approve transition to Phase 2 if client confirmed interest

### Agent Tasks
