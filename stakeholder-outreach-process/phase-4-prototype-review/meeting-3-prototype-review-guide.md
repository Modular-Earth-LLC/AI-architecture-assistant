## Meeting Opening (5 minutes)

**Script:**

"[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME], great to see you again. I'm excited to show you what I've built based on our requirements workshop.

What you're about to see is a working prototype‚Äînot a presentation or a mockup. These are actual AI agents that you can interact with right now. They're functional, but this is still a prototype, not a production system. I'll show you what works well and where there's room for improvement.

Here's how we'll spend the next hour:

1. I'll give you a guided tour of each agent and show what they can do
2. You'll have hands-on time to try them yourself with real scenarios from your work
3. We'll discuss what works, what doesn't, and what's missing
4. We'll talk about the path to a production system

Throughout the demo, I want your honest reactions. If something doesn't make sense, tell me. If you love something, tell me that too. This is all about making sure the final system actually helps your practice.

Any questions before we dive in?"

**Agent Support:**

- feedback-capture-agent begins recording session
- meeting-facilitator-agent displays demo agenda

## Guided Demonstration (20 minutes)

### Demonstration Structure

For each agent (allocate 4-5 minutes per agent):

#### 1. Agent Introduction

"This is [AGENT_NAME]. Its job is to [PURPOSE]. It exists because during our workshop, you mentioned [PAIN_POINT]."

#### 2. Capability Overview

"Here's what this agent can do:

- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]"

#### 3. Live Demonstration

"Let me show you how it works in practice. Let's say [REALISTIC_SCENARIO]..."

**Execute demo scenario:**


- Show user input interface
- Enter realistic request based on client's actual work
- Show agent processing
- Display agent output
- Highlight key features

#### 4. Value Explanation

"Notice how [SPECIFIC_FEATURE]. This addresses the [PAIN_POINT] you mentioned, and should reduce your [TIME_CONSUMING_TASK] from [CURRENT_TIME] to [NEW_TIME]."

#### 5. Transition

"Questions on [AGENT_NAME] before we move to the next one?"

### Agent-by-Agent Demo Script

**Agent 1: [NAME]**

**Introduction:**

"Let's start with [AGENT_NAME]. During our workshop, you mentioned spending [TIME] per week on [TASK]. This agent handles [SPECIFIC_SUBTASK]."

**Demo Scenario:**

[Walk through realistic scenario step by step]

**Key Features to Highlight:**

- [Feature 1]: "See how it automatically [ACTION]"
- [Feature 2]: "Notice that it used your [TEMPLATE/TERMINOLOGY]"
- [Feature 3]: "And it integrated with your [TOOL]"

**Value Statement:**

"Based on our requirements, this should save you approximately [TIME] per [WEEK/PROJECT], and maintain the [QUALITY_ASPECT] you're known for."

---

**Agent 2: [NAME]**

[Repeat structure]

---

### Agent Coordination Demo

"Now let me show you how these agents work together. This is where it gets interesting."

**Demo Scenario:**


[Show multi-agent workflow where user request triggers multiple agents in sequence]

"You asked [SINGLE_REQUEST]. Watch what happens:

1. The orchestrator determines this needs [AGENT_1] and [AGENT_2]
2. [AGENT_1] handles [SUBTASK_1]
3. It passes results to [AGENT_2]
4. [AGENT_2] completes [SUBTASK_2]
5. You get a unified result"

**Value Statement:**

"This coordination means you can ask complex questions and get comprehensive answers without managing multiple tools or agents separately."

## Hands-On Exploration (20 minutes)

**Transition Script:**


"Now I want you to drive. I'm going to give you access to the system, and I want you to try it with real scenarios from your work. Don't worry about breaking anything‚Äîthat's why this is a prototype. I'm here to help if you get stuck, but I want to see how intuitive it is for you.

Think of a real situation from your practice‚Äîmaybe something you're working on right now‚Äîand try using the agents to help with it."

### Facilitation Approach

**Let Client Lead:**

- Don't guide unless they're stuck
- Observe what they try first (reveals intuitive usage)
- Note what confuses them
- Watch for moments of delight or frustration

**Provide Support When Needed:**

- If client stuck for >30 seconds: Offer hint
- If client tries something agents can't do: Explain limitation
- If client asks "Can it do X?": Try it together if possible
- If technical issue occurs: Acknowledge and work around

**Encourage Experimentation:**

- "Try asking it [DIFFERENT_WAY]"
- "What if you wanted to [VARIATION_ON_TASK]?"
- "That's interesting that you tried [APPROACH]‚Äîlet's see what happens"

## Path to Production Discussion (5 minutes)

**Transition Script:**


"Based on your feedback, let me talk about what it would take to turn this prototype into a production system you can rely on daily."

### Explain Production Development

**Script:**


"What you've seen today is a functional prototype, but to make it production-ready, we'd need to:

1. **Refine based on your feedback** - Address the concerns you raised and add the missing capabilities we discussed

2. **Build robust error handling** - Right now, if something goes wrong, it might break. Production version needs to handle errors gracefully.

3. **Enhance security and privacy** - Production system needs stronger authentication, data encryption, and privacy controls

4. **Improve performance** - Some agents were a bit slow. Production version will be optimized for speed.

5. **Add comprehensive documentation** - User guides, training materials, troubleshooting resources

6. **Implement monitoring** - So we can see how it's performing and address issues quickly

7. **Provide ongoing support** - For questions, bugs, and improvements

This typically takes [TIMEFRAME] and involves [SCOPE_DESCRIPTION]."

### Present Options

**Script:**


"I see two paths forward, and I'd like to discuss both with you:

**Option 1: Custom Production System for [CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME]**

This path delivers a production-ready AI agent system tailored specifically to your practice. You get:

- All the capabilities we discussed
- Ongoing support and maintenance
- Regular updates and improvements
- This is your private system for your business

Investment: [RANGE]
Timeline: [WEEKS]

### Option 2: Product Partnership

This path includes everything in Option 1, plus we partner to develop this into a market-ready product for [INDUSTRY] professionals. You get:

- Early access to all capabilities
- Influence on product roadmap
- Recognition as a founding design partner
- Revenue sharing as we bring it to market
- Your practice becomes the reference case

This aligns with the Service-as-Software model where your expertise helps shape a category-defining product.

Investment: [RANGE] or [EQUITY_ARRANGEMENT]
Timeline: [WEEKS]

I'll send you a formal proposal with detailed breakdown of both options. But first, I want to know: Is this something you want to move forward with?"
