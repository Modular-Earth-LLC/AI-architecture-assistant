## Creating Custom Scenarios for Each Client

### Step 1: Review Requirements Workshop Notes

Identify from the workshop:

- Client's 3 most time-consuming tasks
- Client's most frequent pain points
- Client's highest-value deliverables
- Client's most repetitive processes

### Step 2: Map to Agent Capabilities

For each identified task/pain point:

- Which agent(s) address this?
- What would the before/after look like?
- What's the measurable benefit?

### Step 3: Create Realistic Test Data

Based on client's business:

- Sample client names and scenarios
- Realistic data volumes
- Typical input complexity
- Expected output quality

### Step 4: Script the Demo Flow

For each scenario:

- Write exact user input to show
- Document expected agent behavior
- Prepare backup if technical issue occurs
- Note key features to highlight

### Step 5: Practice Each Scenario

Before client demo:

- Run each scenario multiple times
- Time how long each takes
- Ensure outputs are high quality
- Prepare for likely questions

---

## Scenario Selection Strategy

### For Discovery-Stage Demos (First Demo)

Choose scenarios that:

- Address client's top stated pain point
- Show clear, immediate value
- Are simple to understand
- Demonstrate reliably (minimize risk)

### For Hands-On Exploration

Prepare scenarios that:

- Client can try themselves
- Have varied complexity
- Show different agent types
- Allow for experimentation

### For Final Decision Demos

Include scenarios that:

- Demonstrate ROI clearly
- Show agent coordination
- Prove tool integration works
- Address any remaining concerns

---

## Troubleshooting Demo Scenarios

**If scenario fails during demo:**

1. Acknowledge: "That's interesting—let me try a different approach"
2. Have backup: Pre-recorded demo of this scenario
3. Explain: "This is why it's a prototype—these issues are what we'd fix in production"
4. Move on: Don't dwell on the failure, transition to next scenario

**If client asks "Can it do X?" during scenario:**

1. If yes: "Great question—let me show you" (if time permits)
2. If no: "Not yet, but that's exactly the kind of capability we'd add based on your needs"
3. If maybe: "Let's try it and see what happens"
