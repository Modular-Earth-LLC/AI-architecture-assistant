# AI Architecture Assistant

**A practical framework for AI engineers and architects to gather requirements, design multi-agent systems, and deliver AI solutions.**

---

## For AI Engineers and Architects

This repository provides a structured, battle-tested process for taking AI projects from initial client conversation to working prototype. If you design and build AI agent systems, this toolkit helps you:

- **Gather complete requirements** using proven workshop techniques
- **Design robust architectures** with reusable patterns
- **Build working prototypes** fast using agent design templates
- **Deliver professional solutions** with proper handoff documentation

**Everything is copy-paste friendly.** No complex setup, no APIs to configure. Just guides, templates, and prompts you can use immediately.

### Using the Agent Prompts

This toolkit includes specialized AI assistant prompts for use in **Cursor**, **Claude Projects**, or **Claude Workspaces**:

**During requirements:**
- Copy [`requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md`](requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md) into your AI workspace
- Use for real-time guidance during discovery sessions and workshops

**During architecture:**
- Copy [`architecture/technical-architect-agent.prompt.md`](architecture/technical-architect-agent.prompt.md)
- Get architecture recommendations and design patterns

**During development:**
- Copy [`development/prototype-builder-agent.prompt.md`](development/prototype-builder-agent.prompt.md)
- Generate agent prompts, code templates, and demo scenarios

**Advanced workflows:**
- Use prompts in [`architecture/`](architecture/) for specialized tasks:
  - Requirements analysis
  - Tech stack selection
  - Team composition planning
  - Project estimation

## Philosophy

### Human-First, AI-Augmented

This toolkit is designed for **manual execution** first:
- Copy guides into your workflow
- Follow step-by-step processes
- Use templates as starting points
- Leverage AI assistants where helpful

You don't need complex automation. You need clear processes.

### Function Over Perfection

The goal is **working systems**, not perfect systems:
- Prototype to prove value
- Iterate based on feedback
- Ship functional code fast
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability

### Practical, Not Academic

This is a **practitioner's toolkit**:
- Focus on what works in real projects
- Clear recommendations, not endless options
- Examples from actual use cases
- Honest about trade-offs and limitations

2. Categorize pain points (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW for AI)
3. Determine next steps
```

### Using Agent Design Patterns

```bash
# When designing an agent
1. Read architecture/agent-design-patterns.md
2. Choose pattern matching your need:
   - Specialist Agent for focused tasks
   - Document Generator for formatted outputs
   - Research Agent for information gathering
3. Copy prompt template
4. Customize with your domain specifics
5. Test and iterate
```

### Using with Cursor AI

```bash
# Setup
1. Open this repo in Cursor
2. Copy requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md
3. Paste into Cursor chat
4. Cursor will now provide real-time guidance

# During requirements workshop
YOU: "Client just described spending 8 hours/week on manual reporting"
CURSOR: "üî¥ PAIN POINT IDENTIFIED: Manual report generation
         Classification: HIGH - Document generation task
         Suggested follow-up: 'Walk me through creating one report...'
         Potential solution: Report automation agent"
```
