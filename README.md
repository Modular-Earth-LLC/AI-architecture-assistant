## Why This Framework?

Most AI projects fail because teams skip architecture. This framework gives you battle-tested processes, agent patterns, and AI assistants that work together to ship working systems **fast**.

**The problem:** 50% of AI projects stall at POC stage due to poor architecture and planning.

**This solution:** A proven 1-2 week process from concept to prototype, optimized for **speed** and **pragmatism**.

## 🚀 Start Here: 15-Minute Quick Start

**New to AI architecture?** Get your first agent working in 15 minutes:

### Option 1: Use the Quick Start Wizard (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Copy the wizard prompt into Cursor or Claude
requirements/quick-start-wizard.prompt.md

# 2. Answer 10 questions (5 minutes)
# 3. Get your custom requirements doc (instant)
# 4. Follow the generated next steps (10 minutes)
```

**The wizard generates:**
- ✅ Custom requirements document
- ✅ Agent architecture recommendations
- ✅ Technology stack suggestions
- ✅ Clear next steps for your specific use case

### Option 2: Follow the Example

See a complete workflow in action:
1. Read **[Simple Example: Email Automation Agent](examples/email-automation.md)** (5 min)
2. Copy the agent template (2 min)
3. Customize for your use case (8 min)
4. **You have a working agent!**

- **Document Generator** - Formatted outputs (proposals, emails, reports)
- **Research & Synthesis** - Information gathering (competitive intel, market research)
- **Review & Validation** - Quality control (content review, compliance checking)
- **Coordinator/Router** - Orchestration (support routing, task assignment)
- **Chain-of-Thought** - Complex reasoning (problem-solving, planning)
- **Feedback Loop** - Iterative improvement (learning from corrections)
- **Adaptive Agent** - User-aware behavior (adjusts to expertise level)

📖 **[Complete Pattern Library](architecture/agent-design-patterns.md)**

**Scenario:** Automate 2-3 repetitive tasks

**Process:**
1. 30-min discovery → Identify tasks
2. Skip formal workshop, capture requirements in conversation
3. Use "Specialist Agent" pattern
4. Build prototype in 3-5 days
5. Demo and refine

**Result:** 2-3 specialized agents, 20-40 hours effort

---

### Example 2: Multi-Agent System (2-3 weeks)

**Scenario:** Complex workflow automation with integrations

**Process:**
1. Full discovery session
2. 90-min requirements workshop
3. Design multi-agent architecture

5. Comprehensive stakeholder demo

**Result:** 5-7 coordinated agents with integrations, 80-160 hours effort

---

### Example 3: Cursor Integration

```bash
# Real workflow example
1. Open this repo in Cursor
2. Copy requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md into Cursor chat
3. Cursor provides real-time guidance during stakeholder meetings

Example interaction:
YOU: "Stakeholder spends 8 hours/week on manual reports"

CURSOR: 
🔴 PAIN POINT IDENTIFIED: Manual report generation
Classification: HIGH - Document generation task
Follow-up: "Walk me through creating one report step-by-step"
Solution: Report automation agent (estimated 6-hour weekly savings)
```
