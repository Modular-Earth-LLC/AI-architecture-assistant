# AI Solution Architecture Framework

**A practical toolkit for designing and building AI agent systems‚Äîfrom requirements to prototype in 1-2 weeks.**

---

## What This Is

A streamlined framework for anyone doing AI solution architecture. Whether you're a consultant working with stakeholders, an engineer building internal tools, or a product team prototyping features‚Äîthis gives you the structure to go from idea to working prototype fast.

**Core workflow:**

1. **Discover** ‚Üí Understand the problem (30 min)
2. **Document** ‚Üí Capture requirements (90 min)
3. **Design** ‚Üí Architect the solution (2-4 hours)
4. **Build** ‚Üí Create prototype (1-2 weeks)
5. **Demo** ‚Üí Validate and iterate (1 hour)

**Everything is copy-paste ready.** No complex setup. Just guides, templates, and AI assistant prompts you can use immediately.

## Quick Start

### Core Process (1-2 Weeks)

```bash
1. Discovery (30 min)
   ‚Üí Use: requirements/discovery-guide.md
   ‚Üí Understand workflows and identify opportunities

2. Requirements Workshop (90 min)
   ‚Üí Use: requirements/workshop-guide.md + requirements-agent.prompt.md
   ‚Üí Document detailed requirements

3. Architecture Design (2-4 hours)
   ‚Üí Use: architecture/design-guide.md + technical-architect-agent.prompt.md
   ‚Üí Design agent system and select tech stack

4. Prototype Development (1-2 weeks)
   ‚Üí Use: development/prototype-guide.md + prototype-builder-agent.prompt.md
   ‚Üí Build working system

5. Demo & Iterate (1 hour)
   ‚Üí Use: delivery/demo-guide.md
   ‚Üí Validate, gather feedback, refine
```

### Using the AI Assistants

Copy any agent prompt into **Cursor**, **Claude Projects**, **ChatGPT**, or **Mistral** for real-time assistance:

- **`requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md`** - Helps run discovery sessions
- **`architecture/technical-architect-agent.prompt.md`** - Designs system architecture  
- **`development/prototype-builder-agent.prompt.md`** - Generates code and agent prompts
- **Architecture workflow prompts** (5 specialized prompts for requirements analysis, tech stack selection, team composition, project planning, cost estimation)

## What You Get

### ‚úÖ Proven Process

- Battle-tested workflow from real projects
- Optimized for 1-2 week execution by one person
- Focus on working prototypes, not perfect systems
- Clear decision points and quality checks

### ‚úÖ AI Agent Patterns

Reusable agent patterns for common scenarios:

- **Specialist Agents** - Single-task focus

Each pattern includes when to use it, implementation details, and testing approaches.

### ‚úÖ Platform Agnostic

Works with your tools:

- **LLMs:** Claude, GPT-4, Mistral, or any LLM
- **Development:** Python, Node.js, any language
- **Deployment:** Cloud, on-premise, or local
- **AI Tools:** Cursor, Claude Projects, ChatGPT, etc.

### ‚úÖ Copy-Paste Friendly

Every resource is designed for immediate use:

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Real example scripts
- Working code templates
- No complex configuration

---

## Who This Is For

**‚úÖ Perfect for:**

- AI engineers building agent systems
- Solution architects designing AI implementations
- Product engineers prototyping AI features
- Technical leads planning AI projects
- Anyone gathering requirements for AI solutions

**‚ö†Ô∏è Less useful for:**

- ML researchers focused on model development
- Data scientists building predictive models
- Non-technical stakeholders (this is hands-on technical)

---

## Philosophy

### Function Over Perfection

Build working systems that demonstrate value:

- Prototype to prove concepts
- Iterate based on real feedback
- Ship functional code fast
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability

### Human-First Design

AI augments, doesn't replace judgment:

- Clear processes you can follow manually
- AI assistants provide guidance when helpful
- Templates are starting points, not rigid rules
- Adapt everything to your specific context

### Practical, Not Academic

Real-world focused:

- What works in actual projects
- Clear recommendations over endless options
- Examples from real use cases
- Honest about trade-offs and limitations

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Automation (1-2 weeks)

**Scenario:** Need to automate 1-2 repetitive tasks

**Process:**

1. 30-min discovery ‚Üí identify automation opportunity
2. Skip formal workshop, capture requirements in conversation
3. Use "Specialist Agent" pattern from agent-design-patterns.md
4. Build prototype in 3-5 days
5. Quick demo and iterate

**Result:** 1-2 specialized agents, 20-40 hours effort

---

### Example 2: Multi-Agent System (3-4 weeks)

**Scenario:** Multiple coordinated workflows

**Process:**

1. Discovery session ‚Üí understand scope
2. Full 90-min requirements workshop
3. Design multi-agent architecture
4. Build prototype over 2-3 weeks  
5. Demo, gather feedback, handoff

**Result:** 3-5 coordinated agents, 80-160 hours effort

---

### Example 3: Using with Cursor

```bash
# Setup
1. Open this repo in Cursor
2. Open requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md
3. Copy entire prompt into Cursor chat
4. Cursor now provides real-time discovery guidance

# During requirements session
YOU: "Stakeholder mentioned spending 8 hours/week on manual reports"

CURSOR: 
üî¥ PAIN POINT IDENTIFIED: Manual report generation
Classification: HIGH - Document generation task
Suggested follow-up: "Walk me through creating one report..."
Potential solution: Report automation agent
```
