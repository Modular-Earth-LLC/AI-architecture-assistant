# Task

Refactor ai_agents\optimization_agent.system.prompt.md so it does not explicitly mention that it improves any files, workflows, or systems in this repository. Instead, create a user prompt designed exactly for the purpose of self-improvement and improving the entire AI system present in this repository. That new user prompt, stored in C:\Users\paulp\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\AI-architecture-assistant\user_prompts\optimization, must be designe to be ran by the now more generically useful optimization_agent.system.prompt.md. 

Analogous to the [improvement prompt for the](https://github.com/Modular-Earth-LLC/AI-engineering-assistant/blob/main/user_prompts/improve_prompt_engineering_assistant.user.prompt.md) for my prompt engineering assistant, create specialized, purpose-built, targeted self-improvement prompts for each agent in C:\Users\paulp\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\AI-architecture-assistant\ai_agents. These user prompts, stored in the appropriate directory for the corresponding agent in C:\Users\paulp\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\AI-architecture-assistant\user_prompts\, must be designed to be sent in a chat by a user that has loaded the [prompt engineering assistant system prompt](https://github.com/Modular-Earth-LLC/AI-engineering-assistant/blob/main/prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md) as a custom agent chat mode in Cursor, backed by Claude Sonnet 4.5 / Code or Github Copilot backed by Open AI models like GPT 5 /codex (still, though, keep all these prompts general enough to work on other platforms and future versions of Claude and Opus).

Finally, update, iterate, and improve the C:\Users\paulp\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\AI-architecture-assistant\ai_agents\optimization_agent.system.prompt.md so that it now calls each of these specialized improvement prompts targeted at each agent in the @ai_agents directory as the optimization agent iterates on the overall system defined in this AI architecture assistant repository, including improving the improvement prompts before executing them as part of its own process.

If any aspect of this prompt confuses you, or could generate unsafe or unexpected behavior, please ask me for clarification before proceeding.
