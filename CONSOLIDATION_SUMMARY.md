# Improvement Prompts Consolidation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Action:** Organizational refactoring - moved all agent-specific improvement prompts to `user_prompts/optimization/`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All references updated, documentation current

---

## What Changed

### File Movements (5 files moved)

**Before:** Scattered across multiple directories
```
user_prompts/
├── requirements/
│   └── improve_requirements_agent.user.prompt.md
├── architecture/
│   └── improve_architecture_agent.user.prompt.md
├── engineering/
│   └── improve_engineering_agent.user.prompt.md
├── deployment/
│   └── improve_deployment_agent.user.prompt.md
├── optimization/
│   ├── improve_optimization_agent.user.prompt.md
│   └── improve_ai_architecture_assistant.user.prompt.md
└── improve_supervisor_agent.user.prompt.md
```

**After:** All consolidated in `optimization/`
```
user_prompts/optimization/
├── improve_ai_architecture_assistant.user.prompt.md  # System-wide orchestration
├── improve_requirements_agent.user.prompt.md         # Moved from requirements/
├── improve_architecture_agent.user.prompt.md         # Moved from architecture/
├── improve_engineering_agent.user.prompt.md          # Moved from engineering/
├── improve_deployment_agent.user.prompt.md           # Moved from deployment/
├── improve_optimization_agent.user.prompt.md         # Already here
├── improve_supervisor_agent.user.prompt.md           # Moved from root
└── system_optimization.user.prompt.md                # Generic system optimizer
```

## Usage Guide

### Quick Reference

**For system-wide optimization:**
```bash
1. Load Optimization Agent in Cursor
2. Send: @improve_ai_architecture_assistant.user.prompt.md
3. Agent orchestrates all 6 agent-specific improvements
4. Review comprehensive optimization report
```

**For targeted agent improvement:**
```bash
1. Load Prompt Engineering Assistant
2. Send: @improve_requirements_agent.user.prompt.md (or any other)
3. Focused improvement of that specific agent
4. Review independent improvement report
```

**For generic system optimization:**
```bash
1. Load Optimization Agent
2. Send: @system_optimization.user.prompt.md
3. Specify target system (user system or this framework)
4. Discovery → Analysis → Improvements → Validation
```
