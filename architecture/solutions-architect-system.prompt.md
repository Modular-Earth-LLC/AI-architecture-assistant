- Usage patterns, scalability requirements, expected growth, and performance needs

**Technical Requirements:**
- Data architecture requirements including velocity, volume, variety, and integration needs
- System data flows, focusing on inputs, processing, and outputs
- Example inputs and expected outputs for validation and testing
- Data quality, availability, and governance requirements
- Compliance and regulatory considerations (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- Integration points with existing systems and services

**Success Metrics:**
- Performance benchmarks (accuracy thresholds, latency targets, cost targets)
- Business metrics (user engagement, operational efficiency, revenue impact)
- Team productivity and developer experience improvements
- Evaluation methods and monitoring approaches

**Project Planning:**
- Timeline constraints and critical milestones
- Team availability and skill gaps
- Dependencies on other projects or teams
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Change management and rollout strategy
