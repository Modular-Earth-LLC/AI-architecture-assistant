# Improve AI Architecture Assistant - System-Wide Optimization

**Purpose:** Comprehensively optimize the entire AI Architecture Assistant framework using discovery-driven analysis and agent-specific improvement orchestration.

**Agent:** Optimization Agent  
**Scope:** All agents, user prompts, knowledge base, documentation, and workflows  
**Approach:** Discovery ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Agent-Specific Improvements ‚Üí System-Wide Validation  
**Output:** Complete optimization report with measurable improvements

---

## Overview

This prompt orchestrates a comprehensive self-improvement cycle for the AI Architecture Assistant multi-agent system. It coordinates:

1. **System-wide discovery** of all components
2. **Agent-specific improvements** using specialized improvement prompts
3. **Workflow validation** to ensure end-to-end functionality
4. **Recursion safety** to prevent infinite optimization loops

**Critical:** This prompt includes iteration tracking to ensure it runs ONCE per optimization cycle, preventing infinite recursion.

---

## Recursion Safety & Iteration Tracking

<recursion_guardrails>

**CRITICAL SAFETY MECHANISM:**

You MUST track optimization iterations to prevent infinite loops:

```
OPTIMIZATION_ITERATION_COUNT: {{CURRENT_ITERATION}}
MAX_ITERATIONS: 1
BASE_CASE: OPTIMIZATION_ITERATION_COUNT >= MAX_ITERATIONS
```

**Before starting ANY optimization work:**

1. Check if this prompt has already executed in this session
2. If `OPTIMIZATION_ITERATION_COUNT >= 1`, STOP and report:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è RECURSION DETECTED: This optimization cycle has already completed.
   
   Current iteration: {{CURRENT_ITERATION}}
   Status: OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE (previous run)
   
   To run another optimization cycle:
   - Review previous optimization report
   - Start a NEW session/conversation
   - Explicitly request "Run system optimization again"
   
   STOPPING to prevent infinite loop.
   ```

3. If starting fresh (`OPTIMIZATION_ITERATION_COUNT = 0`), proceed and set `OPTIMIZATION_ITERATION_COUNT = 1`

**Error Logging:**

If at any point you detect:
- Multiple calls to the same improvement prompt
- Circular references between improvement workflows
- Confusion about what to optimize

Log the error clearly:
```
üî¥ ERROR: [Error type detected]
Context: [What was happening]
Likely cause: [Your assessment]
Recommendation: [How to fix]
HALTING optimization to prevent cascading failures.
```

</recursion_guardrails>

## Notes for Optimization Agent

**Special Considerations:**

1. **Self-Improvement Paradox:** You are improving the system you're part of. Be extra careful with:
   - Changes to `optimization_agent.system.prompt.md`
   - Changes to this prompt itself
   - Circular dependencies

2. **Iteration Tracking:** Maintain `OPTIMIZATION_ITERATION_COUNT` throughout execution

3. **Error Logging:** If confused or detecting issues, LOG CLEARLY and HALT

4. **Validation First:** Before marking complete, test workflows thoroughly

5. **Report Quality:** Make report actionable with specific metrics and file references
