## Executive Summary

**Project:** Multi-Agent Financial Operations Assistant  
**Client:** Mission-driven financial consulting firm (ESG/social enterprise focus)  
**Pro Bono Partner:** Modular Earth LLC (open-source AI for social good)  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks discovery to demo  
**Investment:** $0 (pro bono development), ~$200/month projected operating costs  
**Impact:** 15-20 hours/week time savings, enabling consultant to serve 3x more mission-driven clients

### The Challenge

A financial consultant running a small, mission-focused practice spends 60% of their time on operational tasks (invoicing, expense tracking, financial reporting, client data management) instead of high-value strategic consulting for social enterprises.

### The Solution

A team of specialized AI agents that automate financial operations, allowing the consultant to focus on what matters most: helping mission-driven businesses thrive financially while maximizing social impact.

### The Approach

**Open-Source First:** Modular Earth developed the prototype as open-source software to benefit the broader community of mission-driven consultants before creating a proprietary MVP for the specific client.

**Result:** Working prototype in 3 weeks, deployed to Cursor IDE for daily use, with production roadmap identified.

## Customer Story

### The Consultant

**Background:**  
Our consultant (let's call them "Alex") has over a decade of advanced financial experience across multiple industries—from beverages and bottling to SaaS and non-profit leadership. Alex founded their consultancy to leverage strategic thinking and financial modeling expertise for social good.

**Mission:**  
Alex intentionally focuses on clients who want to prove mission-driven companies can thrive financially. Using an ESG lens (environment, social, governance), Alex helps businesses align with evolving expectations while achieving performance goals.

**The Problem:**  
Despite expertise in strategic planning, financial analysis, and organizational capacity building, Alex spends 15-20 hours per week on:
- Creating invoices for diverse clients (nonprofits, B-corps, startups)
- Tracking expenses across multiple projects
- Generating monthly financial reports
- Managing client data and project details
- Preparing for stakeholder meetings

This operational burden limits capacity. Alex can only serve 4-5 clients simultaneously, when the market demand could support 12-15.

**The Opportunity:**  
If AI could handle operational tasks, Alex could:
- Serve 3x more mission-driven clients
- Focus on high-value strategic work
- Scale impact without hiring overhead
- Maintain the personalized service that clients value

### The AI Engineer

**Background:**  
An AI engineer volunteers pro bono with Modular Earth LLC, a not-for-profit organization supporting free and open-source development of AI-driven applications for social good. Modular Earth's mission is to make wealth accessible to working-class people in an increasingly volatile job market.

**Motivation:**  
The engineer sees an opportunity to create an AI solution that:
1. Helps a mission-driven consultant scale their impact
2. Creates open-source tools for other solo consultants
3. Demonstrates AI-as-a-public-service principles
4. Validates the AI Architecture Assistant framework

**Approach:**  
Build an open-source prototype first, document the process thoroughly, then create a proprietary MVP tailored to Alex's specific needs.

**Key Components:**

1. **Supervisor Agent**
   - Analyzes user intent: "Generate invoice" → route to Invoice Agent
   - Handles multi-step workflows: "Analyze expenses and create report" → Expense Agent → Reporting Agent
   - Maintains conversation context across agent interactions

2. **Invoice Agent** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   - Generates professional invoices from project data
   - Applies client-specific branding and terms
   - Outputs formatted PDF

3. **Expense Agent** (Claude 3 Haiku - cost optimization)
   - Processes receipt images/PDFs (OCR via Claude's vision)
   - Categorizes expenses (IRS categories + project codes)
   - Flags duplicates or anomalies

4. **Financial Reporting Agent** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   - Aggregates invoice and expense data
   - Generates narrative financial summaries
   - Creates monthly P&L, cash flow, project profitability reports

5. **Client Data Agent** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   - Manages client and project information
   - Retrieves data for other agents
   - Updates records as needed

**Data Flows:**

- **Flow 1 (Invoice Generation):** User → Supervisor → Invoice Agent → Knowledge Base (read project/client) → Generate PDF → Return to user
- **Flow 2 (Expense Processing):** User uploads receipt → Supervisor → Expense Agent → OCR + Categorize → Knowledge Base (write) → Confirm to user
- **Flow 3 (Financial Report):** User → Supervisor → Reporting Agent → Knowledge Base (read invoices/expenses) → Generate report → Return to user

**Security Boundaries:**
- All data stored locally on Alex's machine
- No cloud storage for sensitive client financial data
- API calls to Anthropic are stateless (no data retention per policy)
- Future cloud deployment will use encryption at rest and in transit

**Decision documented in:** `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json → architecture_design`

st.caption("Your AI team for invoice generation, expense tracking, and financial reporting")

# Initialize supervisor agent
if "supervisor" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.supervisor = SupervisorAgent()

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat history
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])

# Chat input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What can I help you with?"):
    # Add user message
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
    
    # Get agent response
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        with st.spinner("Processing..."):
            response = st.session_state.supervisor.process(prompt)
            st.markdown(response)

        # Read image
        with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:
            image_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()
        
        # Call Claude with vision
        response = self.llm_client.complete_with_vision(
            system_prompt=self.load_prompt("expense_agent"),
            user_message="Extract and categorize this expense receipt",
            image_data=image_data
        )
        
        # Parse expense data
        expense_data = json.loads(response)
        
        # Check for duplicates
        if self.db.check_duplicate_expense(expense_data):
            expense_data['flagged'] = True
            expense_data['flag_reason'] = "Possible duplicate"
        
        # Save to database
        expense_id = self.db.create_expense(expense_data)
        
        return expense_id, expense_data
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ OCR accuracy: 95%+ on clear receipts
- ⚠️ OCR accuracy: 70-80% on crumpled/faded receipts
- ✅ Categorization: 90%+ accuracy (validated against Alex's historical data)
- ✅ Duplicate detection: 100% (same vendor+date+amount)
- ⚠️ Project assignment: 60% accuracy (requires more context) - Alex reviews this

**Optimization:** Used Claude 3 Haiku for expense categorization (10x cheaper than Sonnet), Sonnet only for complex/ambiguous receipts

#### Day 11: Client Data Agent

**Straightforward CRUD operations, minimal AI needed:**

```python
class ClientDataAgent(BaseAgent):
    def add_client(self, client_data):
        client_id = self.db.create_client(client_data)
        return client_id
    
    def get_client(self, client_name):
        client = self.db.search_client(client_name)
        return client
    
    def update_client(self, client_id, updates):
        self.db.update_client(client_id, updates)
        return True
```

**Testing:**

    st.metric("This Month's Revenue", f"${current_month_revenue:,.2f}")
    
    current_month_expenses = db.get_monthly_expenses(datetime.now().year, datetime.now().month)
    st.metric("This Month's Expenses", f"${current_month_expenses:,.2f}")
    
    profit = current_month_revenue - current_month_expenses
    profit_margin = (profit / current_month_revenue * 100) if current_month_revenue > 0 else 0
    st.metric("Profit Margin", f"{profit_margin:.1f}%")
    
    st.divider()
    
    # File upload
    st.subheader("📎 Upload Receipt")
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Drag & drop receipt image", type=['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'pdf'])
    if uploaded_file:
        with st.spinner("Processing receipt..."):
            expense_data = st.session_state.supervisor.process_receipt(uploaded_file)
            st.success(f"Expense added: {expense_data['category']} - ${expense_data['amount']:.2f}")
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Discovery-Driven Approach:** The Requirements Agent uncovered pain points Alex hadn't articulated, leading to better-targeted features
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Specialized agents (vs. single generalist) produced higher quality outputs with better cost control
3. **Pro Bono + Open-Source Model:** Created broader impact while serving specific client need
4. **Iterative Testing:** UAT session caught issues before they became problems in daily use
5. **AI Architecture Assistant Framework:** Saved 10-15 hours by following structured workflow (vs. ad-hoc development)

### Challenges & Solutions ⚠️

1. **Challenge:** OCR accuracy on poor-quality receipts (70-80%)
   - **Solution:** Prompt users to retake photo if confidence low; manual fallback available

2. **Challenge:** Context management in multi-agent workflows
   - **Solution:** Added explicit context passing between agents (improved in production MVP)

3. **Challenge:** LLM costs higher than estimated ($180 vs. $150/month)
   - **Solution:** Optimized prompts, used Haiku for simple tasks → reduced to $160/month by Week 3

4. **Challenge:** Client hesitancy about AI-generated invoices
   - **Solution:** Alex reviews all invoices for first month → built confidence → now sends directly
