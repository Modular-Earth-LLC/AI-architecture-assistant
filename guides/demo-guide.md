# Prototype Demo Guide

**Purpose:** Effectively demonstrate your AI agent prototype to client/stakeholders  
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**When to use:** After prototype development, before production decision

---

## Overview

The prototype demo is where you prove the concept works and gather feedback. Your goals are to:

1. **Demonstrate value** - Show the system solves real problems
2. **Enable hands-on testing** - Let stakeholders try it themselves
3. **Gather feedback** - Learn what works and what doesn't
4. **Build confidence** - Prove technical feasibility

**This is not a sales pitch.** Focus on functionality, gather honest feedback, and iterate.

## Demo Structure

### 1. Opening (5 minutes)

**Set Expectations:**

*"Thanks for your time today. I'm excited to show you what I've built based on our requirements workshop.*

*What you're about to see is a working prototype—not a mockup or presentation. These are functional AI agents you can interact with. This is still a prototype, so I'll show you what works well and where there's room for improvement.*

*Here's our agenda:*
*- Guided demo of each agent (20 min)*
*- Hands-on time for you to try it (20 min)*  
*- Feedback discussion (10-15 min)*
*- Next steps (5-10 min)*

*Throughout, I want your honest reactions—both positive and critical. This feedback shapes the final system.*

*Any questions before we start?"*

---

### 2. Guided Demonstration (20 minutes)

#### For Each Agent (4-5 minutes per agent):

**a) Introduction**

*"This is [AGENT_NAME]. Its purpose is to [PURPOSE]. This addresses the [PAIN_POINT] you mentioned in our workshop."*

**b) Capability Overview**

*"Here's what this agent can do:*
*- [Capability 1]*
*- [Capability 2]*  
*- [Capability 3]"*

**c) Live Demonstration**

*"Let me show you with a realistic scenario..."*

**Execute demo scenario:**
1. Show the input interface
2. Enter realistic request (based on their actual work)
3. Show agent processing
4. Display the output
5. Highlight key features

**d) Value Connection**

*"Notice [SPECIFIC_FEATURE]. This should reduce your [TASK] from [CURRENT_TIME] to [NEW_TIME]."*

**e) Transition**

*"Questions on [AGENT_NAME] before moving to the next one?"*

#### Demo Script Template

```markdown
### Agent 1: [NAME]

**Setup:** [What you'll show]

**Scenario:** "Let's say you need to [realistic situation]..."

**Input:** [What you type/enter]

**Point out:**
- "See how it automatically [feature 1]"
- "Notice it used your [terminology/template]"
- "And it integrated with [tool]"

**Value:** "This should save approximately [time] per [period]"

**Transition:** "Any questions? Let's move to Agent 2..."
```

#### Multi-Agent Coordination Demo

If you have coordinated agents, show one workflow:

*"Now let me show how these agents work together.*

*Watch what happens when you ask [COMPLEX_REQUEST]:*
*1. The orchestrator routes to [AGENT_1]*
*2. [AGENT_1] handles [SUBTASK_1]*
*3. Results pass to [AGENT_2]*  
*4. [AGENT_2] completes [SUBTASK_2]*
*5. You get a unified result*

*This means you can ask complex questions without managing multiple tools."*

---

### 3. Hands-On Exploration (20 minutes)

**Transition:**

*"Now I want YOU to drive. I'll give you access to the system. Try it with real scenarios from your work.*

*Don't worry about breaking anything—this is a prototype. I'm here if you get stuck, but I want to see how intuitive it is.*

*Think of something you're working on right now and try using the agents to help."*

#### Facilitation Approach

**Do:**
- ✅ Let stakeholder lead
- ✅ Observe quietly
- ✅ Note what they try first
- ✅ Watch for confusion or delight
- ✅ Encourage experimentation

**Don't:**
- ❌ Guide unless they're stuck (>30 seconds)
- ❌ Take over the keyboard
- ❌ Explain before they try
- ❌ Defend design choices

**Helpful Prompts:**
- *"Try asking it [DIFFERENT_WAY]"*
- *"What if you wanted to [VARIATION]?"*
- *"That's interesting—let's see what happens"*

#### What to Observe

**Usage Patterns:**
- Which agent did they use first?
- Which agent did they use most?
- Which agent did they avoid?
- What did they try that you didn't expect?

**Pain Points:**
- Where did they get confused?
- Where did they hesitate?
- What features couldn't they find?
- What did they expect that wasn't there?

**Positive Signals:**
- What did they use naturally without prompting?
- What made them smile or lean forward?
- What did they comment positively on?
- Did they try multiple scenarios independently?

---

### 4. Feedback Discussion (10-15 minutes)

**Transition:**

*"Let's pause and talk about what you experienced. I want honest feedback—what worked, what didn't, what's missing."*

#### Structured Questions

**Q1: Overall Reaction**  
*"What's your overall reaction to what you saw and tried?"*

Listen for: Enthusiasm level, specific features mentioned, concerns

---

**Q2: Value Assessment**  
*"Does this solve the problems we identified? Where does it deliver value? Where does it fall short?"*

Listen for: Connection to pain points, ROI perception, gaps

---

**Q3: Usability**  
*"How was the experience? What felt intuitive? What was confusing?"*

Listen for: UX issues, learning curve, interface problems

---

**Q4: Missing Capabilities**  
*"What did you expect to see that's missing? What would you add?"*

Listen for: Feature requests, gaps between expectations and delivery

---

**Q5: Concerns**  
*"What concerns do you have about implementing this?"*

Listen for: Reliability, data security, cost, training, trust

---

**Q6: Real-World Usage**  
*"Think about your typical week. How often would you use this? For what specific tasks?"*

Listen for: Realistic usage frequency, specific applications, workflow fit

---

### 5. Next Steps (5-10 minutes)

**Summarize Feedback:**

*"Based on what you shared, I heard:*

*Positive:*
*- [Key positive feedback]*
*- [What they liked]*

*Areas to improve:*
*- [Critical feedback]*
*- [Missing capabilities]*

*Does that capture it?"*

**Explain Path Forward:**

*"To move from this prototype to a production system, we'd need to:*

*1. Address the feedback you provided*
*2. Add [MISSING_CAPABILITIES]*
*3. Build robust error handling*
*4. Enhance security and monitoring*
*5. Create documentation and training*

*This typically takes [TIMEFRAME].*

*I'll send you:*
*- Meeting summary within 24 hours*
*- Recommendations for production development*
*- Timeline and scope estimates*

*In the meantime, you can keep using this prototype with real work to see how it fits your workflow.*

*Questions?"*

## Common Demo Challenges

### Challenge: Technical Issue During Demo

**Response:**
- Stay calm and acknowledge: *"Looks like we hit a glitch. This is why it's a prototype."*
- Switch to backup (screen recording) if available
- Move to different scenario
- Make note and address later
- Don't spend >2 minutes debugging live

### Challenge: Stakeholder Seems Disengaged

**Response:**
- Ask directly: *"Is this addressing what you expected?"*
- Switch to hands-on earlier
- Focus on their specific pain points
- Ask what they'd like to see

### Challenge: Stakeholder Has Unrealistic Expectations

**Response:**
- Set realistic boundaries: *"That's outside the scope of what AI can reliably do"*
- Explain what IS possible
- Focus on concrete, achievable value
- Don't overpromise

### Challenge: Agent Produces Unexpected Output

**Response:**
- Acknowledge honestly: *"That's not what I expected either"*
- Explain why (if you know)
- Show it working correctly with different input
- Make note for refinement

### Challenge: Stakeholder Can't Think of Use Cases During Hands-On

**Response:**
- Provide specific prompts: *"Try [SPECIFIC_SCENARIO] you mentioned in our workshop"*
- Walk through one scenario together
- Give examples from their work
- This may indicate weak product-market fit—note it

## Tips for Effective Demos

1. **Start with the "wow" moment** - Lead with your best agent
2. **Use real stakeholder data** - Generic examples don't resonate
3. **Keep technical explanations minimal** - They care about "what" not "how"
4. **Embrace imperfection** - It's a prototype, own that
5. **Watch their face more than the screen** - Their reactions tell the story
6. **Ask for specific feedback** - General questions get general answers
7. **Time-box ruthlessly** - Respect the agenda
8. **Follow up fast** - Send summary within 24 hours
