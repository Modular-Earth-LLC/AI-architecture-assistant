# Internal Project Proposals

**Get executive approval for your AI/data initiatives with structured, comprehensive project proposals.**

---

## Overview

This directory contains AI-assisted prompts for creating internal project proposals that secure CTO/CFO approval and budget allocation. Unlike external sales proposals, these are designed for **internal cross-functional alignment** at technology companies.

**What you'll create:**
- Executive-ready project proposals
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Resource allocation plans
- Budget justifications with ROI
- Implementation roadmaps

**Target audience:**
- CTOs and VPs of Engineering (technical validation)
- CFOs and Finance teams (budget approval)
- Product leadership (business value)
- Executive teams (strategic alignment)

---

## When to Use Each Prompt

### 1. **Discovery & Technical Assessment** → `discovery-assessment-proposal.prompt.md`

**Use for:** Early-stage investigation before committing to full project

**Typical scenarios:**
- "Can we actually build this with our tech stack?"
- "Is our data good enough for this ML use case?"
- "Which of these 3 approaches should we take?"
- "Will this integration be simple or complex?"

**Duration:** 2-6 weeks  
**Output:** Go/no-go decision + technical recommendations + effort estimate

**Example:**
> "We want to explore using LLMs for customer support automation, but we're not sure if our historical ticket data is sufficient for training. We need 4 weeks to assess data quality and build a quick prototype to validate feasibility before committing to a full project."

---

### 2. **POC/MVP Implementation** → `poc-mvp-implementation-proposal.prompt.md`

**Use for:** Building proof-of-concept or minimum viable product

**Typical scenarios:**
- Moving from discovery to actual development
- Building POC to validate with real users
- Developing MVP for initial launch
- Replacing manual process with automated solution

**Duration:**
- **POC:** 4-8 weeks (working code, not production-ready)
- **MVP:** 8-16 weeks (production-ready with core features)

**Example (POC):**
> "After successful discovery, we're ready to build a 6-week POC of the customer support agent to test with 10 internal support reps and measure accuracy and time savings."

**Example (MVP):**
> "We're proposing a 12-week MVP that automates tier-1 support ticket routing, which handles 60% of our incoming tickets and should reduce support team workload by 30%."

---

### 3. **Project Proposal Template** → `project-proposal-template.prompt.md`

**Use for:** Creating standardized proposal templates for your organization

**Typical scenarios:**
- Establishing consistent proposal processes
- Need reusable template for all technical projects
- Want to ensure all proposals cover necessary topics

**Output:** Customizable template with all required sections

---

## Complete Workflow

### Scenario 1: Discovery → Implementation

**Week 0: Initial concept**
1. Identify business problem or opportunity
2. Run discovery session (using `requirements/discovery-agent.prompt.md`)
3. Document findings (using `requirements/requirements-extraction.prompt.md`)

**Weeks 1-4: Technical assessment**
4. Create assessment proposal (using `discovery-assessment-proposal.prompt.md`)
5. Get approval for discovery phase
6. Conduct technical assessment
7. Present findings and recommendations

**Decision Gate:** Go/No-Go based on assessment results

**Weeks 5-20: Implementation** (if approved)
8. Create POC or MVP proposal (using `poc-mvp-implementation-proposal.prompt.md`)
9. Get approval for implementation
10. Build and deliver solution
11. Measure success and plan next phase

---

### Scenario 2: Direct to MVP (Post-Discovery)

**If discovery already complete or requirements well-understood:**

1. Use requirements extraction prompt to structure existing information
2. Create MVP implementation proposal
3. Include lessons from discovery/prior projects
4. Get executive approval
5. Build and deliver

---

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Be realistic about timelines** - Account for optimism bias (15-25% buffer)
- **Quantify impact** - Use data, not vague claims ("save 30 hours/week" not "improve efficiency")
- **Address risks honestly** - Executives appreciate transparency
- **Show alternatives** - Demonstrate you've done due diligence
- **Define scope boundaries** - Protect team from scope creep
- **Include success metrics** - Clear, measurable criteria
- **Get stakeholder input** - Validate with affected teams before proposing

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't be sales-y** - This is internal, be honest and direct
- **Don't underestimate** - Better to overestimate and deliver early
- **Don't ignore organizational impact** - Consider change management
- **Don't promise perfection** - MVP means minimal viable, not perfect
- **Don't skip the business case** - CFOs need ROI justification
- **Don't forget ongoing costs** - Infrastructure and maintenance add up
- **Don't work in isolation** - Collaborate with PM, security, DevOps early

## Tips for Executive Approval

### For CTO/VPs of Engineering:

Focus on:
- Technical feasibility and soundness
- Architecture alignment with existing systems
- Team capability assessment
- Technical risk mitigation
- Scalability and maintainability

**Questions they'll ask:**
- "Can we actually build this?"
- "Do we have the right team?"
- "What are the technical risks?"

- Comparison to alternatives (build vs. buy)
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Resource efficiency

**Questions they'll ask:**
- "What's the total cost?"
- "When do we break even?"

## Common Proposal Patterns

### Pattern 1: Automation Project

**Problem:** Manual process taking significant time  
**Solution:** Automated workflow with AI  
**Key metrics:** Time saved, error reduction, cost savings  
**Typical timeline:** 8-12 weeks for MVP

**Proposal focus:**
- Current manual process costs
- Automation approach and technology
- Expected time/cost savings
- Risk: What if automation quality insufficient?
- Mitigation: POC with real users first

---

### Pattern 2: Data/ML Initiative

**Problem:** Decisions made without data insights  
**Solution:** ML model or analytics pipeline  
**Key metrics:** Prediction accuracy, decision quality, business impact  
**Typical timeline:** 4-6 weeks discovery + 12-16 weeks MVP

**Proposal focus:**
- Data availability and quality assessment
- Model approach and expected performance
- Infrastructure requirements
- Risk: Data insufficient or model not accurate enough
- Mitigation: Discovery phase first, phased rollout

---

### Pattern 3: Integration/Platform

## FAQs

**Q: How detailed should proposals be?**  
A: Enough for informed decision, not overwhelming. Executive summary in 2 pages, full proposal in 10-20 pages depending on complexity.

**Q: Should I include code or technical specs?**  
A: High-level technical approach in main proposal, detailed specs in appendix. CTO needs architecture, not implementation details.

**Q: What if I don't have all the answers?**  
A: Be honest. Identify unknowns and propose discovery phase to derisk. Better than guessing and being wrong.

**Q: How do I handle changing requirements?**  
A: Include scope change process in proposal. Define decision rights and approval process for changes.

**Q: Should I create proposal before or after discovery?**  
A: After discovery for major projects. For small projects, requirements gathering + proposal can be combined.

**Q: What if my proposal gets rejected?**  
A: Ask why. Common reasons: unclear ROI, too risky, wrong timing, insufficient validation. Address gaps and repropose or pivot.
