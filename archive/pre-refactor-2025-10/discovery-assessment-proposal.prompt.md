# Discovery & Technical Assessment Proposal

**Copy this prompt into Cursor or Claude when creating proposals for technical discovery, feasibility assessment, or AI readiness evaluation projects.**

**Optimized for:** Technical feasibility evaluation | AI/data readiness assessment | Risk mitigation | Executive validation

---

## Purpose

Generate focused project proposals for discovery and assessment phases that help validate technical feasibility before committing to full implementation. These shorter-duration projects (typically 2-6 weeks) reduce risk and provide data for informed decision-making.

**Use this when:**
- Exploring a new AI/data opportunity with uncertain feasibility
- Assessing technical readiness for a major initiative
- Evaluating multiple technical approaches before choosing one
- Need to de-risk a complex project through upfront research
- Want to validate business value before full investment

**Typical duration:** 2-6 weeks  
**Typical team size:** 2-4 people part-time

## What is a Discovery/Assessment Project?

A time-boxed technical investigation to answer critical questions before proceeding with full implementation:

**Common types:**
- **Technical Feasibility:** Can we build this with our tech stack and data?
- **AI Readiness:** Is our data suitable for ML? What performance can we expect?
- **Integration Assessment:** Can we integrate with System X? What's the complexity?
- **Technology Evaluation:** Which of 3 options best fits our needs?
- **Performance Validation:** Will this meet our latency/accuracy requirements?
- **Data Quality Analysis:** Is our data sufficient for the intended use case?

**Key characteristics:**
- Bounded scope and timeline (typically 2-6 weeks)
- Focused on answering specific questions
- Produces recommendations, not production code
- Relatively low cost and risk
- Gates decision to proceed with full project

## Guidelines for This Proposal Type

**Keep scope tight:**
- Focus on answering specific questions
- Time-boxed duration (don't let it drag on)
- Limited to assessment, not production development
- Small team, part-time allocation

**Be honest about uncertainty:**
- Acknowledge what we don't know
- Don't oversell what assessment will reveal
- Present multiple scenarios

**Make it actionable:**
- Clear decision criteria upfront
- Concrete deliverables
- Specific recommendations
- Path to implementation if greenlit

**Justify the investment:**
- Show how assessment reduces risk
- Demonstrate cost of proceeding without discovery
- Compare to alternative of "just building it"
- Emphasize information value

---

## Next Steps After Approval

1. **Kickoff meeting** - Align team on objectives and approach
2. **Set up infrastructure** - Provision any needed resources
3. **Weekly check-ins** - Keep stakeholders informed
4. **Mid-point review** - Adjust if needed
5. **Final presentation** - Deliver findings and recommendation
6. **Decision meeting** - Executive team decides next steps
7. **If proceed:** Transition to full project proposal
8. **If not:** Document learnings and close

This discovery/assessment approach de-risks major initiatives by providing data and validation before committing significant resources, leading to more successful outcomes and better resource allocation decisions.
