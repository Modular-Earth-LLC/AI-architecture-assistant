# POC & MVP Implementation Proposal

**Copy this prompt into Cursor or Claude when creating proposals for Proof of Concept (POC) or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) implementations.**

**Optimized for:** Production delivery | Internal stakeholder alignment | Resource allocation | Executive approval

---

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive implementation proposals for building Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) that secure executive approval and align cross-functional teams.

**Use this when:**
- Moving from discovery/assessment to actual implementation
- Building a POC to validate approach with real users
- Developing an MVP for initial product launch
- Need executive approval and budget for development
- Transitioning from idea to working system

**Typical duration:**
- **POC:** 4-8 weeks
- **MVP:** 8-16 weeks

---

## POC vs. MVP: When to Use Each

### Proof of Concept (POC)

**Purpose:** Validate that an approach works in practice with real data

**Characteristics:**
- Working code but not production-ready
- Limited features focused on core hypothesis
- May cut corners on error handling, UI polish, scalability
- Meant to demonstrate feasibility and value
- Often leads to decision on whether to build MVP

**Example use cases:**
- "Can we accurately extract data from these documents?"
- "Will users find value in this AI assistant?"
- "Can we achieve sub-second response times?"

**Timeline:** Typically 4-8 weeks

---

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Purpose:** Build smallest version that delivers user value in production

**Characteristics:**
- Production-ready code with proper architecture
- Core features only, focused on primary use case
- Proper error handling, monitoring, security
- Meant for real users (internal or external)
- Foundation for future iteration and expansion

**Example use cases:**
- "Launch basic version to first 50 beta users"
- "Replace manual process for one workflow"
- "Automate most common use case end-to-end"

**Timeline:** Typically 8-16 weeks
