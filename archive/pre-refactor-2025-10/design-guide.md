# AI System Architecture Design Guide

**Purpose:** Translate requirements into technical system architecture  
**When to use:** After requirements are approved, before development begins  
**Output:** System architecture document and technical specifications

---

## Overview

Architecture design is where you transform business requirements into a buildable technical system. This phase determines:

- What agents you'll build and what they do
- How agents coordinate and communicate
- What technology stack to use
- How to integrate with existing tools
- How to deploy and scale the system

**Key principle:** Design for the requirements you have, not for imagined future needs. Start simple, make it work, then iterate.

---

## Architecture Design Process

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis (30-60 minutes)

Review the requirements document and extract:

**Business Requirements:**
- Services to support
- Tasks to automate
- Integration needs (tools and systems)
- Scale requirements (users, volume, frequency)
- Performance expectations (response time, availability)

**Constraints:**
- Budget (development and operational)
- Timeline (when it needs to be ready)
- Existing technology (stakeholder's current stack)
- Security requirements (compliance, data protection)
- Team capabilities (technical sophistication)

**Success Criteria:**
- How will success be measured?
- What metrics matter to the stakeholder?
- What's the minimum viable system?

---

### Step 2: Agent Decomposition (1-2 hours)

Break the system into individual agents. Each agent should:

- Have a clear, single purpose
- Take defined inputs and produce defined outputs
- Be independently testable
- Potentially be used alone (not require the whole system)

**Agent Design Template:**

```markdown
## Agent: [NAME]

**Purpose:** [One sentence description of what this agent does]

**Addresses Pain Points:**
- [Pain Point 1 from requirements]
- [Pain Point 2 from requirements]

**Inputs:**
- [Input 1]: [Format and source]
- [Input 2]: [Format and source]

**Processing:**
- [Step 1 of what the agent does]
- [Step 2 of what the agent does]

**Outputs:**
- [Output 1]: [Format and destination]
- [Output 2]: [Format and destination]

**Dependencies:**
- External systems: [List]
- Other agents: [List]
- Data requirements: [List]

**Performance Target:**
- Response time: [X] seconds
- Accuracy requirement: [Y]%

**Failure Modes:**
- [How it might fail]
- [Fallback strategy]
```

**Example:**

```markdown
## Agent: Financial Report Generator

**Purpose:** Automatically generates monthly financial reports from QuickBooks data

**Addresses Pain Points:**
- Manual report creation (8 hours/month)
- Data entry errors
- Inconsistent report formatting

**Inputs:**
- QuickBooks data export (CSV)
- Report template (DOCX)
- Stakeholder-specific parameters (JSON)

**Processing:**
- Parse QuickBooks data
- Calculate financial metrics (ratios, trends)
- Generate narrative analysis using LLM
- Format report using template
- Apply brand voice guidelines

**Outputs:**
- Formatted report (PDF)
- Summary statistics (JSON)
- Generation log (for audit)

**Dependencies:**
- QuickBooks API
- Document generation service
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (for narrative)

**Performance Target:**
- Complete report in <2 minutes
- 95% accuracy vs manual report

**Failure Modes:**
- QuickBooks API down → Use cached data, flag as preliminary
- Data validation fails → Alert user, provide debugging info
- Template missing → Use default template, notify user
```

### Step 3: System Architecture Design (1-2 hours)

#### Choose an Orchestration Pattern

**Simple Orchestrator (1-3 agents):**

Use when: You have a few independent agents with simple routing needs.

```
User Request → Simple Router → Agent → Response

Pros: Fast to build, easy to understand, minimal complexity
Cons: Limited flexibility, manual routing logic
Best for: Prototypes, simple systems
```

**Intent-Based Orchestrator (4-6 agents):**

Use when: You have multiple agents and need intelligent routing.

```
User Request → LLM Router → Appropriate Agent → Response

Pros: Handles ambiguity, natural language routing
Cons: Extra LLM call adds latency and cost
Best for: General-purpose agent systems
```

**Workflow Orchestrator (7+ agents, complex flows):**

Use when: You have multi-step processes spanning several agents.

```
Workflow Definition → State Machine → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent N → Result

Pros: Supports complex multi-agent workflows, state management
Cons: More complex to build and debug
Best for: Complex business processes
```

#### Design Integration Architecture

For each external system, determine:

**Integration Method:**
- ✅ **REST API** - Best option if available
- ⚠️ **Webhook** - Good for real-time events
- ⚠️ **File Export/Import** - Acceptable for batch processes
- ❌ **RPA/Screen scraping** - Last resort only

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 (preferred)
- API keys (acceptable)
- Basic auth (avoid if possible)
- Session-based (avoid)

**Data Flow:**
- Read-only (safest)
- Write-only (moderate risk)
- Read-write (requires careful testing)

**Error Handling:**
- Retry logic (with exponential backoff)
- Fallback strategies
- User notifications
- Logging and monitoring

---

### Step 4: Technology Stack Selection (30-60 minutes)

#### LLM Platform

**Primary recommendation: Anthropic Claude**

- **Sonnet 4.5** for most agent tasks (balance of capability and cost)
- **Opus** only if complex reasoning required
- **Haiku** for simple classification (when available)

**Why Claude:**
- Excellent instruction following
- Strong reasoning capabilities
- Good at maintaining context
- Reasonable pricing
- API reliability

**Alternatives to consider:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 (if stakeholder prefers or has existing relationship)
- Azure OpenAI (if enterprise compliance needed)
- Local models (only if strict data privacy requirements)

#### Orchestration Framework

**For Simple Systems:**
- Custom orchestration in Python
- Direct API calls to LLM provider
- Minimal abstraction

**For Medium Systems:**
- LangChain (popular, well-documented)
- LlamaIndex (if heavy RAG needs)
- Custom framework on FastAPI

**For Complex Systems:**
- AutoGen (Microsoft multi-agent framework)
- Custom state machine on FastAPI
- LangGraph (for complex workflows)

#### Backend Stack

**Recommended: Python + FastAPI**

**Why:**
- Python: AI/ML ecosystem, LLM libraries, stakeholder familiarity
- FastAPI: Async support, auto-documentation, type safety, performance
- Wide hiring pool if stakeholder needs to maintain later

**Alternatives:**
- Node.js + Express (if stakeholder team is JS-heavy)
- Go (if performance is critical)
- Keep it simple - don't over-engineer

#### Frontend Stack

**For Prototypes:**
- Streamlit (fastest to build, Python-native)
- Gradio (good for ML interfaces)
- Simple HTML + JavaScript (if minimal UI)

**For Production:**
- React (most popular, easy to hire for)
- Next.js (if SEO or SSR needed)
- Vue.js (simpler than React)

**For Internal Tools:**
- Retool (low-code, fast)
- Streamlit (Python-friendly)
- n8n (workflow automation)

#### Data Storage

**For Most Systems:**
- PostgreSQL (relational data, reliable, well-understood)
- Redis (caching, session management)
- S3-compatible storage (documents, files)

**If Vector Search Needed:**
- Pinecone (managed, simple pricing)
- Weaviate (open-source, more control)
- pgvector (PostgreSQL extension, keep it simple)

**Avoid over-architecting storage.** Start with PostgreSQL and add specialized databases only when needed.

#### Deployment

**For Prototypes:**
- Railway.app (simple, good free tier)
- Vercel (for Next.js frontends)
- Local Docker containers (if stakeholder wants on-prem)

**For Production:**
- AWS (most features, stakeholder likely already uses)
- Google Cloud (better ML tools)
- Azure (if stakeholder is Microsoft-heavy)
- Docker + Docker Compose (simple deployments)
- Kubernetes (only if scale demands it)

## Common Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single-Agent System

```
User → Agent → External API → Response
```

**Use for:** Simple automation tasks, single workflow

**Example:** Email responder that drafts replies based on company knowledge base

### Pattern 2: Multi-Agent with Routing

```
User → Router → [Agent A | Agent B | Agent C] → Response
```

**Use for:** Different types of requests to different specialists

**Example:** Customer service system with billing, technical, and general agents

### Pattern 3: Sequential Workflow

```
User → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Response
```

**Use for:** Multi-step processes where each step depends on previous

**Example:** Research → Analysis → Report Generation pipeline

### Pattern 4: Parallel Processing

```
User → Orchestrator → [Agent A, Agent B, Agent C] (parallel) → Synthesizer → Response
```

**Use for:** When multiple agents can work simultaneously

**Example:** Competitive analysis gathering data from multiple sources at once

### Pattern 5: Human-in-the-Loop

```
User → Agent 1 → Human Review → Agent 2 → Response
```

**Use for:** High-stakes decisions requiring human judgment

**Example:** Legal document generation with lawyer review before finalization

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

**At Rest:**
- Encrypt sensitive data in database (AES-256)
- Use encrypted storage for files
- Secure credential storage (AWS Secrets Manager, env vars)

**In Transit:**
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- HTTPS only
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

### Access Control

**Authentication:**
- API keys for machine-to-machine
- OAuth for user access
- MFA for admin access

**Authorization:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Agent-level permissions

**Audit Logging:**
- Log all agent actions
- Track data access
- Monitor for anomalies
- Retain logs per compliance requirements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Over-architecting:** Don't build for scale you don't need  
❌ **Under-architecting:** Don't ignore obvious future needs  
❌ **Tool obsession:** Choose boring, proven technology  
❌ **Vendor lock-in:** Maintain ability to switch providers  
❌ **Ignoring costs:** Track LLM API usage from day one  
❌ **Skipping security:** Build it in, don't bolt it on  
❌ **No monitoring:** You can't improve what you don't measure  
❌ **Perfect is the enemy of good:** Ship working system, iterate
