# Requirements Workshop Guide

**Purpose:** Comprehensive requirements gathering for AI agent system design  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**When to use:** After successful discovery session, before architecture design

---

## Overview

The requirements workshop is a structured deep-dive into the client's operations. Your goal is to capture enough detail to design and build an AI agent system that actually solves their problems.

This workshop produces a requirements document that becomes the blueprint for your architecture and development work.

## Workshop Structure

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Set expectations:**

*"[NAME], thanks for this time. Over the next 90 minutes, we're going to map your operations in detail. This will feel thorough‚Äîthat's intentional. The more I understand how you work, the better I can design AI agents that fit your process rather than fighting it.*

*I'll ask lots of specific questions and take detailed notes. There are no wrong answers‚ÄîI need your honest operational reality, not an idealized version.*

*We'll cover six areas: market positioning, brand voice, how you go to market, service delivery workflows, business objectives, and technology stack. The bulk of our time will be on service delivery because that's where AI has the most impact."*

## Section 1: Industry & Market Positioning (15 minutes)

### Questions

1. "What industry are you in, and what industries do you serve?"
2. "How do you describe your services to potential clients?"
3. "What makes your approach different from competitors?"
4. "Who is your ideal client?"
5. "What problems do clients have when they come to you?"

### What to Capture

- Primary industry vertical
- Target client profile
- Unique value proposition
- Competitive differentiation
- Common client pain points

### Why It Matters

Understanding market context helps you design agents that:
- Use appropriate industry terminology
- Address real market problems

## Section 4: Core Service Delivery (25 minutes)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST CRITICAL SECTION

This section requires the most time and detail. For each major service, walk through the complete workflow.

### Process for Each Service

For client's top 2-3 services, ask:

1. **Service overview:** "Describe [SERVICE] from the client's perspective. What are they getting?"

2. **Workflow walkthrough:** "Walk me through delivering this service step by step, from contract signing to final delivery."

3. **Digital work:** "For each step, what digital work is involved? What gets created on a computer?"

4. **Judgment vs. routine:** "Which parts require your expert judgment? Which parts are more rule-based?"

5. **Bottlenecks:** "Where does this slow down? What takes longer than you'd like?"

6. **Delegation candidates:** "If you had a perfect assistant who followed instructions exactly, what parts could you delegate?"

7. **Tools & templates:** "What tools do you use? Do you have templates or frameworks?"

### Example Deep Dive

**Client:** "I do financial modeling for SaaS companies."

**Follow-up sequence:**
1. "What specific models do you create most often?"
2. "Walk me through creating one model from scratch."
3. "What data sources do you pull from?"
4. "What parts are formulaic? What requires your judgment?"
5. "How long does a typical model take?"
6. "Do you use a template or start fresh?"
7. "What software do you use?"
8. "What would I see you doing in the first hour?"

### What to Capture

For each service:

- Complete workflow diagram (step-by-step)
- Input requirements (data, documents, information)
- Output deliverables (reports, models, presentations)
- Time requirements (per step and total)
- Decision points requiring expertise
- Routine or repetitive tasks
- Bottlenecks and delays

## Workshop Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

### Summarize Opportunities

*"[NAME], this has been incredibly valuable. Let me summarize what I'm hearing as the highest-priority opportunities:*

*1. A **[AGENT_TYPE]** that handles [SPECIFIC_TASK], reducing your [X]-hour manual process to [Y] hours of review*

*2. A **[AGENT_TYPE]** that [SPECIFIC_TASK], cutting [PROCESS] time in half*

*3. A **[AGENT_TYPE]** that [SPECIFIC_TASK], freeing you from [ROUTINE_WORK]*

*Does that align with your priorities? Am I missing anything?"*

### Explain Next Steps

*"Here's what happens next:*

*1. I'll compile everything into a detailed requirements document within 48 hours*
*2. You'll review it to ensure accuracy*
*3. Once confirmed, I'll design the system architecture*
*4. Then I'll build a working prototype (usually takes 2-3 weeks)*
*5. We'll meet again for you to test the prototype with real work*

*Let's schedule the prototype review meeting for [DATE_3_WEEKS_OUT]. Does that work?"*

### Final Questions

*"Before we wrap‚Äîany questions about the process? Anything else I should know that didn't fit into today's structure?"*

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Client gives surface-level answers
**Solution:** Use the "tell me about last time" approach  
*"Rather than generally, tell me about the last time you did [TASK]. Walk me through that specific instance."*

### Client jumps between topics
**Solution:** Acknowledge and redirect  
*"That's interesting‚Äîlet me note that. We'll come back to it after [CURRENT_SECTION]."*

### Client says "it depends" for everything
**Solution:** Focus on the common case  
*"I understand it varies. What are the 2-3 most common scenarios?"*

### Client doesn't know technical details
**Solution:** Focus on use cases  
*"That's fine‚Äîjust tell me what you use it for day-to-day. I'll research the technical details."*

### Running significantly over time
**Solution:** Prioritize and schedule follow-up  
*"We have 30 minutes left and still need to cover [X] and [Y]. I may need a brief follow-up call. Let's prioritize [MOST_CRITICAL] for the rest of today."*

### Client fixates on AI limitations
**Solution:** Validate and redirect  
*"You're absolutely right that AI can't [X]. That's why we're not proposing to automate that. Your judgment is irreplaceable. We're looking at whether AI can handle the routine parts so you have more time for strategic work."*
