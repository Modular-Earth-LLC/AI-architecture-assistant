# Discovery Guide

**Purpose:** Understand client needs, identify technical requirements, and assess AI solution opportunities  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**When to use:** Initial client meeting or project kickoff

---

## Overview

The discovery session is your first technical conversation with a client or stakeholder. Your goal is to understand their business context, identify pain points that AI could address, and determine if a requirements workshop is needed.

This is a listening and learning session, not a selling session.

---

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

### Research Tasks (15-30 minutes)

1. **Review client materials:**
   - Website and public documentation
   - Industry context and common challenges
   - Technology they mention using

2. **Prepare examples:**
   - 3-5 AI agent use cases relevant to their industry
   - Similar problems you've solved before
   - Concrete examples of automation opportunities

3. **Technical setup:**
   - Video conferencing ready
   - Note-taking system prepared
   - Ability to share screen if needed

## Discovery Session Structure

### 1. Opening (5 minutes)

**Set expectations:**

*"Thanks for your time today. I'd like to understand how [COMPANY] operates and where you see opportunities for AI to help. This is exploratory—my goal is to understand your challenges and determine if AI agents could genuinely address them. Please be candid about what's working and what isn't."*

### 2. Business Context (10 minutes)

**Key questions:**

- "What are your core services or processes?"
- "Who are your clients/users, and what does a typical engagement look like?"
- "Walk me through your role—what do you handle versus delegate?"
- "What tools and systems do you use daily?"

**What to capture:**

- Service delivery model
- Current delegation patterns
- Technology stack (tools mentioned)
- Business scale and complexity
- Technical sophistication level

### 3. Pain Point Identification (10-15 minutes)

**Key questions:**

- "What tasks take the most time but feel repetitive?"
- "Where do you feel bottlenecked in your work?"
- "What tasks would you delegate if you could?"
- "What deliverables take longer than you'd like?"

**Listen for AI-suitable opportunities:**

✅ **Good candidates for AI:**
- Digital/computer-based tasks
- Repetitive or rule-based processes
- Time-consuming but low-judgment activities
- Data processing or document generation
- Research or information gathering

❌ **Poor candidates for AI:**
- High-stakes strategic decisions
- Novel problem-solving requiring deep expertise
- Relationship building requiring human nuance
- Physical tasks without digital components

**Capture details:**
- Exact description of pain points (use their words)
- Frequency and time spent
- Current workarounds
- Impact on business (time, quality, capacity)

### 4. Opportunity Framing (5-10 minutes)

**Share relevant examples:**

*"Based on what you've shared, I see some interesting opportunities. For example, [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT] sounds like something an AI agent could handle. In similar situations, we've built agents that [CONCRETE_EXAMPLE]. This doesn't replace your judgment—it handles the [repetitive/time-consuming/routine] parts so you can focus on [strategic/high-value] work."*

**Approach:**
- Be specific to their pain points
- Use concrete examples, not abstractions
- Focus on time savings and quality
- Avoid overwhelming with technical details

### 5. Next Steps (3-5 minutes)

**Determine path forward:**

**If strong fit (3+ AI-suitable pain points):**
*"I'm hearing several opportunities where AI agents could help. The next step would be a requirements workshop—about 90 minutes where we map your processes in detail and identify where AI provides the most value. This gives us enough to build a working prototype. Does that sound worthwhile?"*

**If moderate fit (1-2 pain points):**
*"There might be some opportunities here. Let me do some research on [SPECIFIC_AREA] and we can schedule a follow-up call to explore further."*

**If weak fit (no clear AI opportunities):**
*"I appreciate your time. Based on what you've shared, AI agents might not be the best fit for your current challenges. If your situation changes, feel free to reach out."*

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Client gives vague answers
**Solution:** Ask for specific recent examples  
*"Tell me about the last time you did [TASK]. Walk me through that specific instance."*

### Client jumps between topics
**Solution:** Acknowledge and refocus  
*"That's interesting—let me note that and we can come back to it. First, I want to understand [CURRENT_TOPIC]."*

### Client doesn't see AI opportunities
**Solution:** Use concrete examples from their industry  
*"In [SIMILAR_BUSINESS], we built an agent that handles [SPECIFIC_TASK]. Do you do anything similar?"*

### Client expects AI to do everything
**Solution:** Set realistic expectations  
*"AI is excellent at [SPECIFIC_TASKS] but still requires your expertise for [JUDGMENT_TASKS]. Think of it as a capable assistant, not a replacement."*

## Success Indicators

✅ **Good discovery session:**
- Client articulates 3+ pain points clearly
- At least 2 pain points are AI-suitable
- Client can envision AI helping
- Client commits to next step (workshop or follow-up)
- Meeting stays on time (30-45 minutes)

⚠️ **Red flags:**
- No clear pain points ("everything is fine")
- Client wants AI for novelty, not solving real problems
- Unrealistic expectations about AI capabilities
- Client resistant to structured process
- All identified problems require human judgment

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Listen more than you talk** - Aim for 70% client, 30% you
2. **Capture their exact words** - Use their terminology, not yours
3. **Probe for specifics** - "Tell me more about that" is your friend
4. **Don't oversell** - If it's not a fit, say so
5. **Focus on one problem deeply** rather than many superficially
6. **Take detailed notes** - You'll need this for requirements phase
7. **Confirm understanding** - Repeat back what you heard
